## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- MySQL Server
- Git

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codesphere.git
   cd codesphere
   ```
   (Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/codesphere.git` with your actual repo URL.)

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   - Create a MySQL database named `PL7`:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE PL7;
     USE PL7;
     ```
   - Import or run the SQL scripts (e.g., from the `database` folder or inline scripts) to set up tables and procedures.

4. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
     ```
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_USER=your_username
     DB_PASSWORD=your_password
     DB_NAME=PL7
     ```
   - (Add API keys for GitHub, Codeforces, etc., if integrated.)

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

6. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
- Visit the landing page to view your streak, join the community, or start a project.
- Use the member details component to manage team activities (e.g., toggle readiness or exit status).
- Explore the leaderboard and stats sections (to be implemented) to track your progress.
